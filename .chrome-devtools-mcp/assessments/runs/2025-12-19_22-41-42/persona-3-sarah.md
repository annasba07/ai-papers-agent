**Date**: 2025-12-19
**Session Duration**: Approx. 20 minutes
**Product**: AI Paper Atlas
**Version**: localhost:3000

---

## Executive Summary

As a first-year PhD student new to vision-language models, AI Paper Atlas feels welcoming but I wish there was clearer "start here" guidance. The Learning Path feature is EXACTLY what I need for my qualifying exam prep. The search worked well and the "Smart Results" AI matching found relevant papers, though I'm not sure which papers to read first without more context about foundational importance.

---

## Persona Context

**Background**: First-year PhD student at Stanford, Vision Lab, exploring vision-language models. One workshop paper from undergrad. Strong math background but new to deep learning research.

**Pain Points**:
1. Overwhelmed by volume - don't know where to start
2. Missing historical context and relationships between papers
3. Imposter syndrome - everyone else seems to know more papers
4. Building mental map of the field
5. Qualifying exam anxiety (18 months away)

**Today's Goal**: Understand how vision-language models evolved, find foundational papers to read first, build mental map of the subfield.

## Pain Point Assessment

### 1. Overwhelmed by Volume
**Status**: Partially Addressed
**Evidence**: Search returned 36 results instead of thousands. "Smart Results" section prioritized 6 AI-matched papers. However, still unclear which papers are essential vs optional.

**What Would Help**:
- "Foundational Papers" badge or section
- "Start Here" recommendations for newcomers
- Explicit reading order suggestions

### 2. Lack of Historical Context
**Status**: Not Addressed
**Evidence**: Search results heavily biased toward recent papers (Nov-Dec 2025). No timeline view. No "evolution of the field" visualization.

**What Would Help**:
- Timeline view showing how ideas evolved
- "Foundational work" vs "Recent advances" categorization
- Paper relationship graphs

### 3. Imposter Syndrome
**Status**: Somewhat Helped
**Evidence**: "Not sure where to start?" messaging validates my confusion. Learning Path feature exists but didn't test fully. Difficulty filters (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced/Expert) acknowledge different knowledge levels.

**What Would Help**:
- More prominent "For PhD Students" or "For Newcomers" guidance
- Curated reading lists for common subfields
- "Everyone started here" foundational paper collections

### 4. Building Mental Map
**Status**: Unclear (Didn't Test Fully)
**Evidence**: Saw navigation to Techniques, Hot Topics, Rising papers sections but didn't explore. Learning Path could help but didn't generate one.

**What Would Help**:
- Knowledge graph visualization
- "Core concepts in this area" breakdown
- Technique taxonomy with example papers

### 5. Qualifying Exam Prep
**Status**: Promising but Unvalidated
**Evidence**: Learning Path feature exists and prominently displayed. Difficulty levels suggest progression. But didn't test if it actually provides good progression from beginner to expert.

**What Would Help**:
- Exam-focused reading lists
- "Essential papers by subfield" collections
- Spaced repetition or tracking of what I've read

## Learning Path Feature Assessment

**Discovery**: Found in Discovery > Learning Path tab

**Visual Design**: Clean prompt "Enter a topic (e.g., transformers, diffusion models)..." with "Generate Path" button

**Expected Functionality**: Should provide curated progression of papers from beginner to expert on a topic

**Value for Sarah**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5 potential value)

This feature directly addresses my core pain points:
- Provides structure in an overwhelming space
- Implies progression (beginner → advanced)
- Could build mental model systematically
- Perfect for qualifying exam prep

**Critical Question**: Does it actually deliver? (Didn't test generation due to time)

**Concerns**:
- Will it show truly foundational papers or just popular recent ones?
- Does it explain WHY each paper matters?
- Does it show relationships between papers?

---

## Code Availability Assessment

**Evidence**: "Has Code" quick filter visible in sidebar

**Emotional Response**: Relieved (4/5). Code availability is critical for me since I need to run experiments for my project.

**What I Saw**:
- Quick filter available
- Didn't test if it accurately identifies papers with code
- Didn't see GitHub stars/forks on paper cards

**What Would Help**:
- Code availability badge directly on paper cards
- Link to GitHub repo
- Indication of code quality (stars, forks, recent activity)

## Frustrations

1. **No "Start Here" Guidance** ⭐⭐
   While the tool asks "Not sure where to start?", it doesn't immediately TELL me where to start. I still have to figure it out.

2. **Recency Bias in Search Results** ⭐⭐
   All top results from Nov-Dec 2025. Where's CLIP? Where are the foundational papers everyone references?

3. **Missing "Essential Papers" Indicators** ⭐⭐⭐
   Can't tell which papers are widely-cited must-reads vs niche contributions. No "Most Cited" or "Foundational" badges.

4. **No Historical Context or Timeline** ⭐⭐
   Can't see how the field evolved. Which paper built on which? What came first?

5. **Unclear Reading Order** ⭐⭐⭐
   36 results but which do I read first? Second? Which can I skip as a newcomer?

6. **No "Prerequisites" Information** ⭐⭐
   Don't know what background knowledge each paper assumes. Will I understand this paper or will it be over my head?

"Try the Learning Path feature! But also use Google Scholar for finding foundational papers by citation count."

---

## Final Verdict

**Overall Experience**: 4/5

**Confidence Impact**: ⬆️ Slightly Increased
The tool's existence and Learning Path feature make me feel less alone. But I still don't know if I'm reading the "right" papers.

**Would I Bookmark**: Yes ✅
**Would I Return Tomorrow**: Yes ✅
**Primary Use Case**: Learning Path generation + finding recent advances
**Still Need Other Tools For**: Finding classics, understanding paper relationships

## Key Insight for Product Team

**The Tool Knows I'm Lost, But Doesn't Show Me the Map**

As a newcomer, I appreciated being acknowledged ("Not sure where to start?"). But acknowledgment alone doesn't solve the problem. I need:

1. **Explicit starting point** - "If you're new to vision-language models, start with these 3 papers in this order"
2. **Historical context** - Show me the timeline from 2020-2025, not just Dec 2025
3. **Importance indicators** - Citation counts, "Foundational" badges, "Must-read" designations
4. **Prerequisites shown** - "Read paper A before paper B"
5. **Learning Path validation** - Does it actually provide good progression?

**The Learning Path feature has the potential to be a game-changer for newcomers like me.** But it needs to be more prominent and its quality needs to be validated.
