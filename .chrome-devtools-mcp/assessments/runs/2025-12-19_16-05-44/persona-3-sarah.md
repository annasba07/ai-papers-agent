# UX Assessment Report: Sarah Kim

## Executive Summary
I'm Sarah, a first-year PhD student at Stanford trying to learn about vision transformers for my upcoming project. I spent 20 minutes with Paper Atlas and couldn't find a single paper. The tool appears to have no working data - searches return zero results, Discovery pages never load, and I felt more lost and frustrated than when I started. This tool made me feel incompetent rather than helping me learn.

## Session Overview
- **Date**: 2025-12-19
- **Persona**: Sarah Kim, 1st-year PhD student, Stanford Vision Lab
- **Primary goal**: Find papers on vision transformers to understand the field
- **Goal completion**: 0% - Found zero papers
- **Overall rating**: 1/5

## Phase-by-Phase Findings

### Phase 1: First Contact
- **First impression**: Clean, professional interface. "Not sure where to start?" section felt welcoming - exactly what I need as someone uncertain
- **Clarity score**: 4/5 - The value prop was clear ("Search and filter AI research papers")
- **Key observation**: Initial impression was positive, but this is where things went downhill
- **Screenshots**:
  - `01-landing.png` - Professional landing page with helpful onboarding suggestions

### Phase 2: Primary Goal Pursuit
- **Approach taken**:
  1. Tried searching "vision transformer" - got 0 results
  2. Applied Computer Vision category filter - still 0 results
  3. Attempted to use Discovery page - endless loading
- **Success level**: Complete failure - 0% goal achievement
- **Friction points**:
  - Search for "vision transformer" returned zero results (this is a foundational topic!)
  - No explanation why search failed
  - No alternative suggestions when search failed
  - Filters don't help when there's no data
  - "AI-powered semantic search" sounds fancy but never completed
- **Comparison to usual tools**: Google Scholar would have instantly shown me thousands of papers. arXiv search would work. Even just browsing arXiv cs.CV would give me papers. This gave me nothing.
- **Screenshots**:
  - `02-search-typed.png` - Typed search query, saw "Searching..." state
  - `03-no-results.png` - "No papers found" for vision transformers (shocking!)
  - `04-cleared-search.png` - Cleared search, tried different approach
  - `05-cv-filter.png` - Applied Computer Vision filter
  - `06-ai-search-loading.png` - "AI-powered semantic search in progress" but never finished

### Phase 3: Discovery & Exploration
- **Features discovered**:
  - Discovery page with tabs (High Impact, Rising, Hot Topics, etc.)
  - Reading List page (didn't try it - no papers to save)
  - Generate page (didn't explore)
  - Multiple filter options in sidebar
  - "Ask Advisor" button (never worked)
- **Missing features**: The most critical missing feature is... data. There are no papers.
- **Surprises**:
  - BAD: The entire database appears to be empty or broken
  - BAD: The sidebar says "138,986 papers" on first load, then drops to "0 papers" after any interaction
  - BAD: Discovery page tabs all show "Loading..." forever
  - GOOD: The interface design is actually nice and the features look useful (if they worked)
- **Screenshots**:
  - `07-discovery-nav.png` - Discovery page with nice tab layout
  - `08-discovery-loading.png` - "Loading papers..." that never completes
  - `09-hot-topics.png` - "Finding trending topics..." endless loading

### Phase 4: Deep Dive
- **Paper examined**: None - couldn't find any papers to examine
- **Information quality**: N/A
- **AI analysis assessment**: N/A - never got to see any content
- **Screenshots**: None - nothing to deep dive into

### Phase 5: Practical Utility
- **Secondary goal result**: Failed - couldn't assess which papers are "important" because I found zero papers
- **Workflow fit**: Cannot replace any tool when it doesn't work at all
- **Adoption barriers**:
  1. No data appears to be loaded
  2. Search functionality completely broken
  3. Would need to actually return papers to be useful
- **Screenshots**:
  - `10-back-to-explore.png` - Final attempt, still searching with no results

### Phase 6: Reflection
- **Would bookmark**: No - it doesn't work
- **Would return**: No - why would I return to a tool that has no papers?
- **Would recommend**: Absolutely not - I'd be embarrassed to recommend something this broken
- **Top frustration**: The tool appears to have no working database. "138,986 papers" is advertised but I couldn't access a single one
- **Top delight**: The UI design is clean and the feature concepts (Discovery, filters, AI search) sound helpful. But they're useless without data
- **Bottom line as Sarah**: I felt stupid using this tool. As a first-year PhD student already dealing with imposter syndrome, getting "0 results" for basic searches like "vision transformer" made me feel like I was doing something wrong. In reality, the tool is completely broken. This made my uncertainty worse, not better.

## Pain Point Assessment

| Pain Point | Addressed? | Evidence |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| Imposter Syndrome | Made it WORSE | Getting 0 results for fundamental topics made me feel incompetent |
| Vocabulary Gap | No | Never got to see any papers or learn terminology |
| Finding My Niche | No | Can't explore a field with zero papers |
| Quality Judgment | No | Can't learn which papers are important with no data |
| Literature Review Overwhelm | No | Can't be overwhelmed when there's nothing to review |

## Priority Improvements

| Issue | Impact | Effort | Priority |
|-------|--------|--------|----------|
| **No papers load at all** | Critical - tool is unusable | Unknown (data/API issue?) | P0 |
| Search returns 0 results for basic queries | Critical - blocks all use | Unknown | P0 |
| Discovery page never loads content | High - alternative entry point broken | Unknown | P0 |
| "138,986 papers" claim but 0 accessible | High - false advertising damages trust | Low (fix the counter) | P1 |
| No error messages or help when search fails | High - leaves users confused | Low | P1 |
| Endless loading states with no timeout | Medium - wastes user time | Low | P2 |

## Final Verdict

As Sarah Kim, a first-year PhD student trying to learn about vision transformers, this tool completely failed me. Not only did it fail to help - it actively made me feel worse about my abilities.

**The Critical Failure**: The tool has no accessible papers. Searching for "vision transformer" - one of the most important papers in computer vision in the last 5 years - returns zero results. The Discovery page never loads. Every feature appears broken or empty.

**The Emotional Impact**: As someone already dealing with imposter syndrome, seeing "No papers found" for basic topics made me wonder if I was searching wrong, using the wrong terminology, or fundamentally misunderstanding something. The tool made me feel incompetent rather than empowered.

**What I Expected**: Even a simple database of arXiv papers with basic search would have helped me. Google Scholar works. arXiv works. This doesn't.

**What Would Make This Useful**:
1. Actually load papers into the database
2. Make search work for common queries
3. When search fails, explain why and suggest alternatives
4. For learners like me: show what makes papers "important" or "foundational"
5. Provide context and connections between papers to help understand the field

**Star rating**: ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5)

**Bottom line**: I cannot use a paper discovery tool that has no papers. The interface looks professional and the features sound helpful, but without working data and search, it's completely unusable. I would not recommend this to anyone until the core functionality is fixed. As a PhD student trying to learn, this tool made me feel more lost and uncertain than when I started.
